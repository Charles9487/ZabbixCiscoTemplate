# ZabbixCiscoTemplate
Generic template for low-level-discovery of Cisco Devices to return Device Model Name, Serial Number, and other items. The code was adapted to work with Zabbix 3.0. Based off the work presented [here](https://github.com/jjmartres/Zabbix/tree/master/zbx-templates/zbx-cisco/zbx-cisco-envmon)
Thank you jjmartres for allowing your work to be used freely. 

Updated SNMP OID discovery to work with Zabbix 3.0 since there are syntax changes in Low Level Discovery
